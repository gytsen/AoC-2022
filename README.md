# AoC-2022
Advent of code 2022 in perfectly fine and readable code

## how to run
You'll need a reasonably modern version of Node.js, like 16 or 18.
The input should be in the `input/2022/` directory in the form of `${day_number}.txt`, so day 10 should be
listed as `input/2022/10.txt`.
There are no prerequisites, besides being willing to part with your sanity.

```bash
$ node main.js
```

I have no regrets.
